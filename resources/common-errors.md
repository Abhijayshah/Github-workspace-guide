## üîê Authentication & Access Errors

### Error: "Permission denied (publickey)"

**What it means:** SSH authentication failed - GitHub can't verify your identity.

**Common causes:**
- SSH key not added to GitHub account
- SSH agent not running
- Wrong SSH key being used
- SSH key passphrase issues

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if SSH key exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.ssh
   # Look for id_rsa.pub, id_ed25519.pub, or similar
   ```

2. **Generate new SSH key if needed:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Add SSH key to SSH agent:**
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

4. **Add SSH key to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # Copy public key to clipboard
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy  # macOS
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard  # Linux
   
   # Then paste in GitHub Settings > SSH and GPG keys
   ```

5. **Test SSH connection:**
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

**Prevention:** Regularly test SSH connection and keep keys secure.

### Error: "remote: Invalid username or password"

**What it means:** HTTPS authentication failed.

**Common causes:**
- Using password instead of personal access token
- Expired or invalid personal access token
- Two-factor authentication enabled without token

**Solutions:**

1. **Create Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token with appropriate scopes
   - Use token as password when prompted

2. **Update stored credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Clear stored credentials
   git config --global --unset user.password
   
   # Use credential helper
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

3. **Switch to SSH:**
   ```bash
   # Change remote URL from HTTPS to SSH
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
   ```

**Prevention:** Use SSH keys or keep personal access tokens updated.

## üìÅ Repository & Remote Errors

### Error: "fatal: not a git repository"

**What it means:** You're trying to run Git commands outside a Git repository.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if you're in the right directory:**
   ```bash
   pwd
   ls -la  # Look for .git folder
   ```

2. **Navigate to repository:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/repository
   ```

3. **Initialize repository if needed:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

**Prevention:** Always check your current directory before running Git commands.

---

### Error: "fatal: remote origin already exists"

**What it means:** Trying to add a remote that already exists.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check existing remotes:**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

2. **Update existing remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin <new-url>
   ```

3. **Remove and re-add remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```

**Prevention:** Check existing remotes before adding new ones.

---

### Error: "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"

**What it means:** Git refuses to merge branches that don't share common history.

**Common causes:**
- Merging a new repository with existing one
- Repository was recreated
- Force-pushed history changes

**Solutions:**

1. **Allow unrelated histories:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

2. **Alternative approach:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

3. **For new repositories:**
   ```bash
   # If you have a README on GitHub but local repo doesn't
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

**Prevention:** Initialize repositories consistently and avoid recreating them.

---

## üåø Branch & Merge Errors

### Error: "error: pathspec 'branch-name' did not match any file(s) known to git"

**What it means:** The branch you're trying to checkout doesn't exist.

**Solutions:**

1. **List available branches:**
   ```bash
   git branch -a  # Show all branches
   ```

2. **Create the branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch-name
   ```

3. **Fetch remote branches:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout -b branch-name origin/branch-name
   ```

4. **Check for typos:**
   ```bash
   git branch | grep -i "partial-name"
   ```

**Prevention:** Double-check branch names and use tab completion.

---

### Error: "error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge"

**What it means:** You have uncommitted changes that conflict with incoming changes.

**Solutions:**

1. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Save local changes"
   git merge <branch-name>
   ```

2. **Stash your changes:**
   ```bash
   git stash
   git merge <branch-name>
   git stash pop  # Apply stashed changes back
   ```

3. **Discard local changes (careful!):**
   ```bash
   git checkout -- <file-name>
   # Or for all files:
   git reset --hard HEAD
   ```

**Prevention:** Commit or stash changes before switching branches or merging.

---

### Merge Conflicts

**What it means:** Git can't automatically merge changes from different branches.

**Example conflict markers:**
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Incoming changes
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Manual resolution:**
   ```bash
   # Edit the conflicted files
   # Remove conflict markers and choose desired content
   git add <resolved-file>
   git commit
   ```

2. **Use merge tool:**
   ```bash
   git mergetool
   ```

3. **Abort merge:**
   ```bash
   git merge --abort
   ```

4. **Accept one side completely:**
   ```bash
   # Accept your changes
   git checkout --ours <file-name>
   
   # Accept their changes
   git checkout --theirs <file-name>
   ```

**Prevention:** 
- Communicate with team about changes
- Merge frequently to avoid large conflicts
- Use smaller, focused commits

---

## üì§ Push & Pull Errors

### Error: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally"

**What it means:** Remote branch has commits that your local branch doesn't have.

**Solutions:**

1. **Pull first, then push:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Fetch and rebase:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Force push (dangerous!):**
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin main
   # Only use if you're sure about overwriting remote history
   ```

**Prevention:** Always pull before pushing, especially on shared branches.

---

### Error: "fatal: couldn't find remote ref"

**What it means:** The branch you're trying to push to doesn't exist on remote.

**Solutions:**

1. **Push and set upstream:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin branch-name
   ```

2. **Check remote branches:**
   ```bash
   git ls-remote origin
   ```

3. **Create branch on remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin HEAD:new-branch-name
   ```

**Prevention:** Use `-u` flag when pushing new branches.

---

## üíæ Commit & Staging Errors

### Error: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

**What it means:** No changes to commit.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Check if files are staged:**
   ```bash
   git diff --staged
   ```

3. **Add files if needed:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your message"
   ```

**Prevention:** Use `git status` to check what's staged before committing.

---

### Error: "Please tell me who you are"

**What it means:** Git user configuration is missing.

**Solutions:**

1. **Set user information:**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Check configuration:**
   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```

**Prevention:** Configure Git immediately after installation.

---

### Error: "fatal: bad object HEAD"

**What it means:** Repository is corrupted or has no commits.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if repository has commits:**
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

2. **Make initial commit:**
   ```bash
   echo "# Project" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. **If repository is corrupted:**
   ```bash
   git fsck --full
   ```

**Prevention:** Make initial commit immediately after repository creation.

---

## üîÑ Rebase & Reset Errors

### Error: "fatal: It seems that there is already a rebase-apply directory"

**What it means:** Previous rebase operation wasn't completed.

**Solutions:**

1. **Continue rebase:**
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

2. **Abort rebase:**
   ```bash
   git rebase --abort
   ```

3. **Skip current commit:**
   ```bash
   git rebase --skip
   ```

4. **Force cleanup (last resort):**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .git/rebase-apply
   ```

**Prevention:** Complete or abort rebase operations before starting new ones.

---

### Error: "error: cannot 'squash' without a previous commit"

**What it means:** Trying to squash the first commit in interactive rebase.

**Solutions:**

1. **Change first commit to 'pick':**
   ```
   pick abc123 First commit
   squash def456 Second commit
   ```

2. **Use 'edit' instead:**
   ```
   edit abc123 First commit
   pick def456 Second commit
   ```

**Prevention:** Understand interactive rebase commands before using them.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Tag & Release Errors

### Error: "fatal: tag 'v1.0' already exists"

**What it means:** Trying to create a tag that already exists.

**Solutions:**

1. **List existing tags:**
   ```bash
   git tag
   ```

2. **Delete existing tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag -d v1.0
   git push origin --delete v1.0  # If pushed to remote
   ```

3. **Use different tag name:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   ```

**Prevention:** Check existing tags before creating new ones.

---

## üìÇ File & Directory Errors

### Error: "fatal: pathspec 'file.txt' did not match any files"

**What it means:** File doesn't exist or path is incorrect.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check file exists:**

   ls -la
   find . -name "file.txt"
   ```

2. **Check current directory:**
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

3. **Use correct path:**
   ```bash
   git add path/to/file.txt
   ```

**Prevention:** Use tab completion and verify file paths.

---

### Error: "warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF"

**What it means:** Line ending differences between operating systems.

**Solutions:**

1. **Configure line endings:**
   ```bash
   # For Windows
   git config --global core.autocrlf true
   
   # For Mac/Linux
   git config --global core.autocrlf input
   ```

2. **Disable warning:**
   ```bash
   git config --global core.safecrlf false
   ```

**Prevention:** Set up line ending configuration early in project.
