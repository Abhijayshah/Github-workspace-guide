2. **Practice: Create a Strategic Issue**:
   Choose one of your core projects and create a well-researched issue:
   
   ```bash
   # Research the project thoroughly
   cd your-core-project
   
   # Study recent issues and discussions
   gh issue list --limit 20
   gh issue list --state closed --limit 10
   
   # Look for patterns and gaps
   grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" . --include="*.js" --include="*.py"
   ```

3. **Types of Strategic Issues**:

   ```markdown
   # Performance Issue Template
   
   ## Performance Problem
   **Current Performance**: [Specific metrics]
   **Expected Performance**: [Target metrics]
   **Measurement Method**: [How you measured]
   
   ## Reproduction Steps

   ```

### Step 2: Excel at Code Reviews

Become a reviewer that others appreciate and learn from:

1. **Code Review Checklist**:
   ```markdown
   # Code Review Checklist
   
   ## Functionality
   - [ ] Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
   - [ ] Are edge cases handled appropriately?
   - [ ] Is error handling comprehensive?
   - [ ] Are there any obvious bugs?
   
   ## Code Quality
   - [ ] Is the code readable and well-structured?
   - [ ] Are variable and function names descriptive?
   - [ ] Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
   - [ ] Does it follow project conventions?
   
   ## Testing
   - [ ] Are there adequate tests for new functionality?
   - [ ] Do existing tests still pass?
   - [ ] Are test cases comprehensive?
   - [ ] Is test code quality good?
   
   ## Documentation
   - [ ] Is new functionality documented?
   - [ ] Are code comments helpful and necessary?
   - [ ] Is the PR description clear and complete?
   - [ ] Are breaking changes documented?
   
   ## Security & Performance
   - [ ] Are there any security vulnerabilities?
   - [ ] Could this impact performance negatively?
   - [ ] Are resources properly managed?
   - [ ] Is input validation adequate?
   ```

2. **Review Comment Templates**:
   
   **Constructive Feedback**:
   ```markdown
   # Good Review Comments
   
   ## Suggesting Improvements
   "Consider using `Array.map()` here instead of a for loop for better readability:
   ```javascript
   const results = items.map(item => processItem(item));
   ```
   This approach is more functional and easier to understand."
   
   ## Asking Questions
   "I'm curious about the choice to use recursion here. Have you considered the stack overflow risk for large datasets? Maybe an iterative approach would be safer?"
   
   ## Praising Good Work
   "Excellent error handling here! I love how you've provided specific error messages that will help users debug their issues."
   
   ## Requesting Clarification
   "Could you help me understand the logic in lines 45-52? A comment explaining the algorithm would be helpful for future maintainers."
   ```

3. **Practice: Review Real PRs**:
   ```bash
   # Find PRs to review in your projects
   gh pr list --state open
   
   # Check out PR locally for testing
   gh pr checkout 123
   
   # Run tests and examine changes
   npm test
   git diff main..HEAD
   ```

### Step 3: Become a Mentor

   # Rebase onto different branch
   git rebase --onto main feature-old feature-new
   
   # Rebase with conflict resolution
   git rebase main
   # Resolve conflicts
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   ```

3. **Advanced Collaboration Workflows**:
   ```bash
   # Co-authored commits
   git commit -m "Implement feature X
   
   Co-authored-by: Partner Name <partner@email.com>"
   
   # Cherry-pick specific commits
