## üìñ Theory Section

### What is Branching?

**Branch** = An independent line of development

Imagine you're writing a book:
- **Main branch** = Your published chapters
- **Feature branch** = Draft chapters you're working on
- **Merge** = Adding finished draft chapters to the main book

### Why Use Branches?

1. **Safety**: Experiment without breaking working code
2. **Organization**: Separate different features/fixes
3. **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work simultaneously
4. **History**: Clear record of what changed and when

### Branch Visualization

```
main:     A---B---C---F---G
               \         /
feature:        D---E---/
```

- A, B, C: Initial commits on main
- D, E: Feature development on separate branch
- F: Merge feature into main
- G: Continued development on main

### Types of Branches

**Main/Master Branch**:
- Production-ready code
- Always stable and deployable
- Protected from direct changes

**Feature Branches**:
- New features or enhancements
- Named descriptively: `add-user-login`, `fix-payment-bug`
- Merged back to main when complete

**Hotfix Branches**:
- Critical bug fixes
- Created from main, merged back quickly
- Named: `hotfix-security-patch`

### Merge Types

**Fast-Forward Merge**:
- No new commits on main since branch creation
- Simply moves main pointer forward
- Linear history

**Three-Way Merge**:
- New commits exist on both branches
- Creates a merge commit
- Preserves branch history

## üíª Hands-On Practice

### Step 1: Understanding Current Branch Status

1. **Check Current Branch**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/repository
   git branch
   git status
   ```
   
   The `*` shows your current branch (probably `main`)

2. **View Branch History**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph
   ```

### Step 2: Creating Your First Branch

1. **Create and Switch to New Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-about-page
   ```
   
   This command:
   - Creates a new branch called `feature/add-about-page`
   - Switches to that branch immediately
   - `-b` flag means "create and checkout"

2. **Verify Branch Creation**:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```
   * feature/add-about-page
     main
   ```

3. **Alternative Method** (Git 2.23+):
   ```bash
   git switch -c feature/add-contact-page
   git switch main  # Switch back to main
   git switch feature/add-about-page  # Switch to feature branch
   ```

### Step 3: Making Changes on Feature Branch

1. **Create New File**:
   ```bash
   echo "# About Page" > about.md
   echo "" >> about.md
   echo "This is the about page for our project." >> about.md
   echo "" >> about.md
   echo "## Our Mission" >> about.md
   echo "To learn Git and GitHub effectively!" >> about.md
   ```

2. **Stage and Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add about.md
   git commit -m "Add about page with mission statement"
   ```

3. **Make Another Change**:
   ```bash
   echo "" >> about.md
   echo "## Team" >> about.md
   echo "- Your Name (Developer)" >> about.md
   git add about.md
   git commit -m "Add team section to about page"
   ```

4. **View Branch History**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph
   ```

### Step 4: Switching Between Branches

1. **Switch to Main Branch**:
   ```bash
   git switch main
   # or
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Notice the Difference**:
   ```bash
   ls
   cat README.md
   ```
   
   The `about.md` file doesn't exist on main branch!

3. **Switch Back to Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git switch feature/add-about-page
   ls
   ```
   
   The `about.md` file is back!

### Step 5: Merging Branches

1. **Switch to Main Branch**:
   ```bash
   git switch main
   ```

2. **Merge Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git merge feature/add-about-page
   ```
   
   Expected output:
   ```
   Updating abc1234..def5678
   Fast-forward
    about.md | 8 ++++++++
    1 file changed, 8 insertions(+)
    create mode 100644 about.md
   ```

3. **Verify Merge**:
   ```bash
   ls
   git log --oneline --graph
   ```

4. **Clean Up Branch** (optional):
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/add-about-page
   ```

### Step 6: Creating Merge Conflicts (Learning Experience)

Let's intentionally create a conflict to learn how to resolve it:

1. **Create Two Conflicting Branches**:
   ```bash
   # Create first branch
   git checkout -b update-readme-v1
   echo "# My Awesome Project v1" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Update README title to v1"
   
   # Switch to main and create second branch
   git switch main
   git checkout -b update-readme-v2
   echo "# My Amazing Project v2" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Update README title to v2"
   ```

2. **Merge First Branch**:
   ```bash
   git switch main
   git merge update-readme-v1
   ```

3. **Try to Merge Second Branch** (this will create conflict):
   ```bash
   git merge update-readme-v2
   ```
   
   Expected output:
   ```
   Auto-merging README.md
   CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
   Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
   ```

### Step 7: Resolving Merge Conflicts

1. **Check Conflict Status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **View Conflict in File**:
   ```bash
   cat README.md
   ```
   
   You'll see something like:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   # My Awesome Project v1
   =======
   # My Amazing Project v2
   >>>>>>> update-readme-v2
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflict**:
   Edit README.md to choose the version you want:
   ```bash
   echo "# My Incredible Project" > README.md
   ```

4. **Complete the Merge**:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict: combine both title ideas"
   ```

5. **Clean Up Branches**:
   ```bash
   git branch -d update-readme-v1
   git branch -d update-readme-v2
   ```

### Step 8: Working with Remote Branches

1. **Push Feature Branch to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-footer
   echo "---" >> README.md
   echo "¬© 2024 My Project. All rights reserved." >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add footer to README"
   
   # Push branch to GitHub
   git push -u origin feature/add-footer
   ```

2. **Check GitHub**: Visit your repository on GitHub - you'll see the new branch!

3. **Merge via Command Line**:
   ```bash
   git switch main
   git merge feature/add-footer
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Delete Remote Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete feature/add-footer
   git branch -d feature/add-footer
   ```

- ‚úÖ Make meaningful commits on each branch
- ‚úÖ Successfully merge all branches to main
- ‚úÖ Handle at least one merge conflict
- ‚úÖ Push branches to GitHub and merge them
- ‚úÖ Clean up merged branches

**Project Scenario**: You're building a personal portfolio website

**Features to Implement**:

1. **Branch**: `feature/add-navigation`
   - Create `navigation.md` with site menu
   - Commit: "Add main navigation structure"

2. **Branch**: `feature/add-projects`

## üîç Common Errors and Solutions

### ‚ùå "error: pathspec 'branch-name' did not match any file(s)"
**Solution**: Branch doesn't exist. Check spelling or create it first with `git checkout -b branch-name`.

### ‚ùå "error: Your local changes would be overwritten by checkout"
**Solution**: Commit or stash your changes first: `git stash` or `git commit -am "WIP"`.

### ‚ùå "fatal: A branch named 'feature' already exists"
**Solution**: Use a different name or delete existing branch: `git branch -d feature`.

### ‚ùå "error: cannot delete branch 'feature' checked out at"
**Solution**: Switch to different branch first: `git switch main`, then delete.

### ‚ùå Merge conflict markers in file
**Solution**: Edit file to remove `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers and choose desired content.

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Branch Naming Conventions**:
   ```
   feature/add-user-auth
   bugfix/fix-login-error
   hotfix/security-patch
   chore/update-dependencies
   ```

2. **Check Before Switching**: Always check `git status` before switching branches.

3. **Merge vs. Rebase**: For now, stick with merge. Rebase is advanced and can rewrite history.

4. **Branch Cleanup**: Regularly delete merged branches to keep your workspace clean.

5. **Visual Branch History**:
   ```bash
   git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --all
   ```

6. **Quick Branch Status**:
   ```bash
   git branch -v  # Shows last commit on each branch
   ```
