### The Psychology of Momentum

**What is Contribution Momentum?**
Momentum in open source is the compound effect of consistent, strategic contributions that build upon each other, creating:
- Increased confidence and skills
- Stronger community relationships
- Greater impact and recognition
- More opportunities and invitations
- Sustainable long-term engagement

**The Momentum Equation**:
```
Momentum = Consistency × Quality × Community Engagement × Learning
```

### Common Momentum Killers

**Burnout Patterns**:
- Taking on too much too quickly
- Perfectionism preventing completion
- Lack of clear goals or progress tracking
- Isolation from community support
- Focusing only on code without relationships

**Inconsistency Traps**:
- Waiting for "perfect" opportunities
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Lack of systems and routines
- No backup plans for busy periods
- Comparing yourself to others

### The Sustainable Contributor Model

**The 3-Tier Approach**:

1. **Core Projects** (1-2 projects): Deep, ongoing involvement
2. **Regular Projects** (3-5 projects): Periodic contributions
3. **Exploration Projects** (5-10 projects): Occasional, experimental contributions

**Time Allocation**:
- 60% Core projects (relationship building, significant contributions)
- 30% Regular projects (skill development, diverse experience)
- 10% Exploration (learning, networking, fun)
